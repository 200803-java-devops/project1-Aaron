My super cool application management tool

Still debating ideas, but my initial thoughts are to develop an application deployment/updating and management tool. I will focus on the automated deployment part of the tool and auto-update of application versions. As I have time, I will expand on this to provide more application and monitoring tools.

I will start by picking a colleagues project0 and deploy that via my server. Then will move to make it more general.
