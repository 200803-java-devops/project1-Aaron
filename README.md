The target audience will be able to select and install desired applications to their system or update existing applications. 

### User Stories
- As a developer, I need to submit and manage my java application so that users have access to my application and are satisfied with their experience.
    - As a developer, I need to be able to add a new application with application-specific options to the server so that users can see and use my latest project
    - As a developer, I need to be able to push application updates to all users that have installed my application so that they have the latest and greatest version of my product
    - As a developer, I want to be able to see usage statistics, reviews, and bug reports of my application so that I can improve and update the application accordingly
- As a user, I need to view and install supported java applications on my system so that I can make use of the latest applications
    - As a user, I need to easily install a java application on my system so that I can easily use it, even if I'm not tech savvy
    - As a user, I need to be able to get updates to my installed application or enable auto-updates, so that I have the latest/best working application
    - As a user, I want to be able to submit feedback on an application I'm using so that it can be improved
- As a server manager, I want to be able to remove undesired applications so that I have better control of available applications
